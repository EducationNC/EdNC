## Installation

This project does not include WordPress, so you will need to first download and install WordPress in your project directory.

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/EducationNC/EdNC.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/EducationNC/EdNC/zipball/master) and then place the files into your project directory.

If you don't use [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock), you'll need to add the following to your `wp-config.php` on your development installation:

```php
define('WP_ENV', 'development');
```

## Theme activation

Reference the [theme activation](http://roots.io/roots-101/#theme-activation) documentation to understand everything that happens once you activate Roots.

## Theme development

Roots uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for compiling SASS to CSS, checking for JS errors, live reloading, concatenating and minifying files, versioning assets, and generating lean Modernizr builds.

Pleaes refer to the Roots [README] (https://github.com/roots/roots-sass/blob/master/README.md) for more information on setting up your local dev environment to develop using Grunt.
