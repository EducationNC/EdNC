ACF PRO
=========

Welcome to the Advanced Custom Fields v5 PRO repository. This repository will provide an effective workflow for issue tracking during the ongoing development of this plugin.

Rules
-----
* Please fully read this `README.md`
* Please pull the latest code before any testing
* Please don't share, leak or distribute any code from this repository

How to report an issue
----------------------

All issues are to be reported here: [Create a new issue](https://github.com/AdvancedCustomFields/acf-pro/issues/). Please provide a clear title and comment that describes what the issue is, why it is an issue and how the issue can be recreated. If possible, please provide any errors, code snippets or attachments to aid your description.

Installation
------------

ACF5 introduces a new way to unlock premium add-ons. Previously, each add-on could be purchased and installed separately which made rolling out updates slow and cumbersome. To fix this, ACF5 can be upgraded from the `Free` version to a `PRO` version! The pro version will be purchased with either a single or multi-site license. 

To correctly install ACF5 for beta testing, please follow these steps:

1. Setup a new local WP installation or use an existing one
2. Disabled the `advanced-custom-fields` plugin if already exists
3. Clone this repository into a new folder: `wp-content/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-pro`
4. Activate the `advanced-custom-fields-pro` plugin via wp-admin

### Notes regarding updates

Please do not update the plugin via the `Custom Fields -> Updates` page as this will destroy your `git` data.

The files in this git repository represent the files available for download using a purchased developer license. All `PRO` functionality is included in a `pro` folder. Removing this folder will represent the `FREE` version.

Thank you
---------

Last but not least, I would like to thank you very much for your help in testing this new version of ACF. I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback, and working with you to solve any issues.

Cheers
Elliot
