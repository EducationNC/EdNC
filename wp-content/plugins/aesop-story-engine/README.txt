Suite of components that enables the creation of interactive longform stories in WordPress.

== Description ==

Aesop Story Engine is a suite of open-sourced tools and components that empower developers and writers to build feature-rich, interactive, long-form storytelling themes for WordPress. At the heart of ASE are the suite of storytelling components, which are created on the fly while crafting posts within WordPress.

**Try Aesop for Free** - [http://tryaesop.com](http://tryaesop.com)

Utilizing these components, writers can can take their work to the next level, and developers can utilize the core storytelling engine to build feature-rich, visually compelling WordPress themes. Here’s a demo theme incorporating these story components.
[http://playground.aesopstories.com](http://playground.aesopstories.com)

**Audio** -
Display an audio player with support for MP3 that can be optionally hidden. This is great for showcasing audio interviews.

**Video** -
Showcase a fullscreen video with support for Kickstarter, Viddler, YouTube, Vimeo, Daily Motion, and Blip.TV with support for captions and alignment.

**Content** -
The content component is a multi-purpose component that can display a background image, background color, or can split the content into multiple magazine type columns.

**Character** -
Display a character avatar, title, and small bio to help readers be reminded of key story characters.

**Gallery** -
The ASE Gallery component allows you to create and manage unlimited story galleries. Each gallery can be displayed as a grid, a thumbnail gallery, stacked, or sequential type gallery, all with caption support.

**Chapter** -
Creates scroll-to points with large full-screen images as headings.

**Image** -
The image component displays an image and caption, with optional lightbox. Also allows you to align the image, as well as offset the image so it hangs outside of the content column.

**Map** -
This component allows you to create a map for your story. You can add markers to the map with custom messages, and even have the map scroll to points as you scroll through the story.

**Parallax** -
A fullwidth image component with caption and lightbox. As you scroll, the image moves slightly to provide a parallax effect. Includes optional floater parallax item to use for multiple levels of parallax engagement.

**Quote** -
Show a fullwidth quote with large text, or a standard pull-quote. Control the color and background of the quote component, add parallax effects, and more.

**Timeline** -
Create a story with a timeline that sticks to the bottom. The timeline works a bit like chapters.

**Document** -
This component allows you to upload a PDF or image, that is shown to the user once they click the component.

**Collection** -
The 13th component is meant to be used on a page of your site, and allows you to display stories from a specific collection (category).

Here’s a demo theme incorporating these story components: [http://playground.aesopstories.com](http://playground.aesopstories.com).

Here’s a real story: [http://aesopstoryseri.es/the-quiet-day/](http://aesopstoryseri.es/the-quiet-day).

Here’s documentation on Aesop Story Engine: [http://aesopstoryengine.com/help](http://aesopstoryengine.com/help).

= Theme Implementation =

It’s important to know that the plugin only produces very basic CSS for the components. The theme is responsible for making the components appear different ways. For this reason, the Timeline and Chapter components may not function as intended. Refer to your themes documentation to see if it fully supports Aesop.

Theme authors and developers will find documentation covering everything from the markup that is generated, to actions, filters, and instructions for full Aesop integration here: [http://aesopstoryengine.com/developers](http://aesopstoryengine.com/developers).

** Update 7.31.14 **
Aesop Story Engine 1.0.9 now features full theme compatibility with a simple code snippet that will load styles based on the components that you decide. While a dedicated theme is required to run components full-width, this will at least load all of the additional styles to give a basic design. Simply remove the component that you do not want to load additional styles for.

`add_theme_support("aesop-component-styles", array("parallax", "image", "quote", "gallery", "content", "video", "audio", "collection", "chapter", "document", "character", "map", "timeline") );`

We recommend placing this in a WordPress theme's functions.php, or use a plugin like [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets) and put the snippet in there.

= Developers =
All components are pluggable, and there are ample filters and actions to manipulate just about everything you can imagine. Refer to the documentation for more: [http://aesopstoryengine.com/developers](http://aesopstoryengine.com/developers).

= Languages =
Aesop Story Engine is currently available in 36 languages. We work closely with the folks over at [WP-Translations](https://www.transifex.com/wp-translations/aesop-story-engine), and it's because of them that these translations are available. You're welcome to jump in.

= 1.5.2 =
* FIX - Fixed an issue with the Photoset gallery breaking with the last update
* FIX - Added a capability check so admin_notices aren't shown to non-admins

= 1.5.1 =
* FIX - Massive codebase overhaul bringing Aesop Story Engine close to WordPress VIP plugin standards
* FIX - Combed through the codebase and removed all unused vars and updated php docs per Scrutinizer
* FIX - Undefined $classes variable in Quote component
* FIX - Fixed an issue with the Parallax component where the height would sometimes not be calculated correctly
* FIX - Added additional logic to the Mapbox upgrade process sent with 1.5 to check for an empty value to ensure better upgrade notifications
* FIX - Fixed the welcome page on plugin activation not firing correctly
* ADDED - Added headings to the aesop_component_media_filter

= 1.5 =
* NEW - Welcome screen on plugin activation
* NEW - New "Type" option for Quote Component which allows the quote to be displayed as a standard pull quote
* FIX - Blank map tiles with new Mapbox IDs. Mapbox changed things and now requires a public key for the map tiles. We're using our public key, but have introduced a filter should you need to change this. On this update, we've changed our mapbox id, and have written an upgrade script that will ensure you have a smooth transition in this update
* FIX - The document component css class has been renamed! This was inevitable. It was mis-labeled as document component from day one, so we've fixed it to the proper spelling, of "document" component

= 1.4.2 =
* NEW - Compatibility with Lasso - our soon to be released front-end editor add-on
* NEW - Now available in 14 languages - props wp-translations.org

* FIX - Fixed bug with TinyMCE load dependency
* TWEAK - Better compatibility with the Aesop Lazy Loader add-on
* TWEAK - Prevent "Upgrade Galleries" notice from showing if you've already upgraded galleries
* TWEAK - The Parallax component has gotten a significant overhaul. The most important being that the height attribute is no longer used. Instead, the height of the parallax component is not only fluid and responsive, but it's automatically calculated based on the height of the image that you upload. In this regard it should always be sized perfectly. It's best to use an image at least 800px tall. In addition, the parallax image width is now respected, which means there's no more clipping on left and right. Although we hate to remove the "fixed height" option, and although we realize this might be seen as a jarrying change, we hope you'll enjoy this significant but necessary improvement.

= 1.4.1 =
* FIXED - Yandex in Fotorama : A few updates back we attempted to block Fotorama from inserting its Yandex tracker. Since we noticed that this sometimes fails to block, we've modified their source code and have removed it completely. It's also worth noting that they've gotten a lot of heat from this, and have since removed it all together from their script. This should no longer be an issue, and we apologize for any inconviences that we may have inadvertantly caused.
