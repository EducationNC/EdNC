== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't my popups opening/working? =

There are several common causes for this which include:

* You have not set up your popups targeting conditions (top right when editing a popup).
* Your site is loading multiple copies of jQuery
* Your themes footer.php file doesn't include <?php wp_footer(); ?> or it is not in the correct place (just before the `</body>`).
* WP 4.5's inclusion of jQuery v1.12 broke your theme or another plugin - [More Info](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/stopped-working-suddenly-wp-45?replies=21 "More Info").
* There is a JavaScript error caused by another plugin or your theme. You can check this using your browsers console (Press F12).
