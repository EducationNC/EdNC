The official AdSense Plugin, written by Google. Provides support for AdSense as well as Webmaster Tools.

== Description ==

The AdSense Plugin enables you to easily use Google's products - including Webmaster Tools - with your WordPress site.

This plugin lets you place AdSense ads using a simple point-and-click UI rather than manually inserting snippets yourself. To insert AdSense ads without the plugin would first involve generating the AdSense snippet and then pasting the Adsense snippet into either the text of the site or directly into the PHP. Google automatically determines potential placements for AdSense ads, suggests an initial ad layout, and allows you to lay out ads on your site.

This version of the AdSense Plugin allows you to:

* Easily add AdSense ads to your site to make money from advertising.
* With one click, enable mobile-specific ad layouts with Automated Mobile Ads. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3380277)
* Manage your ads quickly and easily through a point-and-click interface.
* [Manually insert ads](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6051417) in locations that you determine yourself.
* [Exclude pages](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6023216#disable) from having ads on them.
* Verify your site with Webmaster Tools with just one click.

This plugin was previously known as the Google Publisher Plugin.

[Visit Google Help Center](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3380626) for more information.

== Installation ==

Also see the [AdSense help documentation on installing the AdSense Plugin](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3380627).

After installation, you can [set up the plugin](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3380277).

Make sure you meet the minimum system requirements.

* PHP version 5.2.0 or greater.
* WordPress version 3.5 or greater.
* Ability to install third-party WordPress plugins.
* Site hosted outside WordPress.com. WordPress.com [does not allow](http://en.support.wordpress.com/plugins/) this plugin on its hosted sites.

Sign in to your WordPress account and visit the site admin page. You can quickly view this page if you click the WordPress icon in the upper left corner of your WordPress site. Note that you must have permission as an admin of your site to install plugins. If you need help, try [WordPress support](http://wordpress.org/support/).

In the site admin sidebar, click Plugins and select Add New. Enter “Google AdSense Plugin” in the search bar and click Search Plugins.

Find the Google AdSense Plugin in the list of results and click the Install Now link.

At this point, WordPress should automatically install the plugin.

If you have any trouble with automatic installation, you can try it manually. To do this:

* Visit the [WordPress plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-publisher/) page for the AdSense Plugin. If you don't see the plugin page, enter "Google AdSense Plugin" in the Search Plugins box on the left and click Search.
* Download the plugin. It should come in the form of a .zip file.
* Sign in to your WordPress account and visit the site admin page.
* In the site admin sidebar, click Plugins and select Add New.
* Select Upload near the top of the plugins page. Click Choose file and upload your .zip file. Then click Install Now.

= Terms of service =

The plugin source code is GPL, however use of Google Services through the plugin is governed by [Google's Terms of Service](http://www.google.com/policies/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). For products and services that can be used with the AdSense Plugin, such as AdSense, additional Terms of Service may also apply.

= HTML5 Local Storage =

Google uses HTML5 Local Storage in the end-user's browser to record which kind of ad layout it serves to each browser; this includes the number of ads served and their position on the site. This helps Google compare ad performance across different ad layouts. The information is anonymous and is not personally identifiable. Do not use this Google-managed value for your own tracking; it may prevent the plugin from gathering reliable data about ad layouts. Your site should already include the appropriate disclosures about cookie usage, but please ensure that you [make the disclosures required by AdSense terms and conditions](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/1348695).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this an official Google plugin? =

Yes, this plugin is developed and supported by Google. [Visit Google Help Center](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3380626) for more information.

= Can I use the AdSense Plugin on WordPress.com? =

At this time, the AdSense Plugin cannot be used on WordPress.com. WordPress.com [does not allow](http://en.support.wordpress.com/plugins/) this plugin on its hosted sites.

= What are Automated Mobile Ads? =

Google will create mobile-specific ad placements automatically with one click. All ads will have locations and formats that are appropriate for mobile.

= The plugin didn’t find a location where I want to put an ad. How do I insert AdSense ads in those locations? =

You can now [manually insert ads](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6051417?hl=en&ref_topic=3380274) in locations that you determine yourself. This is an easy-to-use compromise between manual insertion of snippets yourself and the plugin’s easy-to-use UI. You get full control plus point-and-click. See the [help documentation](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/6051417?hl=en&ref_topic=3380274) for more information.

= Why should I use this plugin as opposed to others? =

Google officially supports this plugin and any other method of putting the AdSense snippet on your page. This is the only plugin that delivers the Google-suggested ad experience for your site.

All plugins and placements must still adhere to the [AdSense Terms and Conditions](https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms) and it is the responsibility of the publisher to ensure that any tools used for AdSense obey those terms and conditions. It is usually up to the publisher to determine if your content violates ad policy or a placement is deceptive.
