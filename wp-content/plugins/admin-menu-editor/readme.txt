Lets you edit the WordPress admin menu. You can re-order, hide or rename menus, add custom menus and more. 

== Description ==
Admin Menu Editor lets you manually edit the Dashboard menu. You can reorder the menus, show/hide specific items, change premissions, and more.

**Features**

* Change menu titles, URLs, icons, CSS classes and so on.
* Organize menu items via drag & drop.
* Change menu permissions by setting the required capability or role.
* Move a menu item to a different submenu. 
* Create custom menus that point to any part of the Dashboard or an external URL.
* Hide/show any menu or menu item. A hidden menu is invisible to all users, including administrators.

The [Pro version](http://w-shadow.com/AdminMenuEditor/) lets you set per-role menu permissions, hide a menu from everyone except a specific user, export your admin menu, drag items between menu levels, make menus open in a new window and more. [Try online demo](http://amedemo.com/wpdemo/demo.php).

**Notes**

* If you delete any of the default menus they will reappear after saving. This is by design. To get rid of a menu for good, either hide it or change it's access permissions.
* In the free version, it's not possible to give a role access to a menu item that it couldn't see before. You can only restrict menu access further.
* In case of emergency, you can reset the menu configuration back to the default by going to http://example.com/wp-admin/?reset\_admin\_menu=1 (replace example.com with your site URL). You must be logged in as an Administrator to do this.

== Installation ==

**Normal installation**

1. Download the admin-menu-editor.zip file to your computer.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Upload the `admin-menu-editor` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

That's it. You can access the the menu editor by going to *Settings -> Menu Editor*. The plugin will automatically load your current menu configuration the first time you run it.

**WP MultiSite installation**

If you have WordPress set up in Multisite ("Network") mode, you can also install Admin Menu Editor as a global plugin. This will enable you to edit the Dashboard menu for all sites and users at once.

1. Download the admin-menu-editor.zip file to your computer.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Create a new directory named `mu-plugins` in your site's `wp-content` directory (unless it already exists).
1. Upload the `admin-menu-editor` directory to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`.
1. Move `admin-menu-editor-mu.php` from `admin-menu-editor/includes` to `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`.

Plugins installed in the `mu-plugins` directory are treated as "always on", so you don't need to explicitly activate the menu editor. Just go to *Settings -> Menu Editor* and start customizing your admin menu :)

*Notes* 
* Instead of installing Admin Menu Editor in `mu-plugins`, you can also install it normally and then activate it globally via "Network Activate". However, this will make the plugin visible to normal users when it is inactive (e.g. during upgrades).
* When Admin Menu Editor is installed in `mu-plugins` or activated via "Network Activate", only the "super admin" user can access the menu editor page. Other users will see the customized Dashboard menu, but be unable to edit it.

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.1 =
* Fixed "Appearance -> Customize" always showing up as "new" and ignoring custom settings.
* Fixed a WooCommerce 2.2.1+ compatibility issue that caused a superfluous "WooCommerce -> WooCommerce" submenu item to show up. Normally this item is invisible.
* Fixed a bug where the plugin would fail to determine the current menu if the user tries to add a new item of a custom post type that doesn't have an "Add New" menu. Now it highlights the CPT parent menu instead.
* Fixed a very obscure bug where certain old versions of PHP would crash if another plugin created a menu item using an absolute file name as the slug while AME was active. The crash was due to a known bug in PHP and only affected Windows systems with open_basedir enabled.
* Added more debugging information for situations where the plugin can't save menu settings due to server configuration problems.
* Other minor fixes.

= 1.4 = 
* Added a special target page option: "< None >". It makes the selected menu item unclickable. This could be useful for creating menu headers and so on.
* Added a new menu editor colour scheme that's similar to the default WordPress admin colour scheme. Click the "Settings" button next to the menu editor page title to switch colour schemes.
* Fixed strange boxes showing up in the icon selector in Internet Explorer.
* Fixed duplicate top level menus mysteriously disappearing. Now the plugin will properly warn the user that all top level menus must have unique URLs.
* Fixed an obscure bug where changing the "Target page" from the default setting to "Custom" and back would occasionally make some menu properties suddenly show up as modified for no apparent reason.
* Fixed incorrect submenu item height and margins in WP 4.0-beta.
* Fixed a minor layout bug where items with no title would be smaller than other items.
* Fixed combo-box dropdown button height for WP 3.9.x.
* Added a workaround for a bug in WordPress Mu Domain Mapping 0.5.4.3.
* Added a workaround for the very unusual situation where the "user_has_cap" filter is called without a capability.
* Fixed duplicates of bbPress menu items showing up.
* Changed the default custom menu icon to the generic "cogwheel" icon from Dashicons.
* Other small UI changes.
* Raised minimum requirements to WordPress 3.8 or later. This is mainly due to the increased reliance on Dashicons as menu icons.

= 1.3.2 =
* Added a large number of menu icons based on the Dashicons icon font. 
* Fixed default menu icons not showing up in WP 3.9. 
* Fixed a rare "$link.attr(...) is undefined" JavaScript error.
* Fixed a bug where a hidden submenu page with a URL like "options-general.php?page=something" would still be accessible via "admin.php?page=something".
* Fixed several other minor bugs.
* Tested up to WordPress 3.9-RC1. Minimum requirements increased to WP 3.5.

= 1.3.1 =
* Tested with WordPress 3.8.
* Fixed several minor UI/layout issues related to the new 3.8 admin style.
* Fixed a bug where moving an item to a plugin menu and then deactivating that plugin would cause the moved item to disappear.
* Fixed deleted submenus not being restored if their original parent menu is no longer available.
* Fixed a rare glitch where submenu separators added by certain other plugins would sometimes disappear.
* Fixed a conflict with Shopp 1.2.9.
* Made the plugin treat "users.php" and "profile.php" as the same parent menu. This fixes situations where it would be impossible to hide a "Users" submenu item from roles that don't have access to the "Users" menu and instead get a "Profile" menu.
* Added extra logging for situations where a menu item is hidden because a higher-priority item with the same URL is also hidden. 
* Minor performance improvements.

= 1.3 =
* Added a new settings page that lets you choose whether admin menu settings are per-site or network-wide, as well as specify who can access the plugin. To access this page, go to "Settings -> Menu Editor Pro" and click the small "Settings" link next to the page title.
* Added a way to show/hide advanced menu options through the settings page in addition to the "Screen Options" panel.
* Added a "Show menu access checks" option to make debugging menu permissions easier.
* Added partial WPML support. Now you can translate custom menu titles with WPML.
* The plugin will now display an error if you try to activate it when another version of it is already active.
* Added a "Target page" dropdown as an alternative to the "URL" field. To enter a custom URL, choose "Custom" from the dropdown.
* Fixed the "window title" setting only working for some menu items and not others.
* Fixed a number of bugs related to moving plugin menus around.
* Changed how the plugin stores menu settings. Note: The new format is not backwards-compatible with version 1.2.2.

= 1.2.2 =
* Replaced a number of icons from the "Silk" set with GPL-compatible alternatives.
* Tested with WP 3.6.

= 1.2.1 =
* Fixed a rare bug where the icon selector would appear at the bottom of the page instead of right below the icon button.
* Fixed incorrect icon alignment when running the MP6 admin UI.
* Tested on WP 3.6-beta1-24044.

= 1.2 =
* Added an icon drop-down that lets you pick one of the default WordPress menu icons or upload your own through the media library (only in WP 3.5+).
* Fixed misaligned button text in IE/Firefox.
* Fixed menus that have both a custom icon URL and a "menu-icon-*" class displaying two overlapping icons. You can still get this effect if you set the class and URL manually.
* Fixed a compatibility problem with Participants Database 1.4.5.2.
* Tested on WP 3.5.1 and WP 3.6-alpha.

= 1.1.13 =
* Fixed a layout glitch that would cause the editor sidebar to display incorrectly in WP 3.5.
* When trying to determine the current menu, the plugin will now ignore all links that contain nothing but an "#anchor". Various plugins use such links as separators and it wouldn't make sense to highlight them.
* Tested on WP 3.5 (RC6).

= 1.1.12 =
* Fixed several more small CPT-related bugs that would cause the wrong menu to be marked as current. 
* Tested on WP 3.5-beta2.

= 1.1.11 =
* Tested on WP 3.4.2 and WP 3.5-alpha-21879.
* Fixed a visual glitch related to the arrow that's used to expand menu settings. In certain situations clicking it would cause the arrow icon to be briefly replaced with multiple copies of the same icon.
* Fixed the position of the URL and capability dropdown lists. Now they should show up directly under the corresponding input box instead of appearing some distance down and to the right.
* Fixed the size of the toolbar buttons - now they're perfectly square.
* Fixed a rare bug that would sometimes cause the wrong menu to be marked as active/expanded.
* Only display the survey notice on the menu editor page, not on all admin pages.

* Fixed compatibility issues on sites running in SSL mode.

= 1.1.8 =

= 1.1.7 = 
* Tested on WP 3.4
* Fixed a rare "failed to decode input" error.
* Fixed menus not being expanded/collapsed properly when the current menu item has been moved to a different sub-menu.
* Added a shortlist of Pro version benefits to the editor page (can be hidden).

= 1.1.6.1 =
* Tested on WP 3.3.2
* Added a user survey.

= 1.1.6 =
* Tested on WP 3.3.1.
* Fixed a couple 404's in the readme and the plugin itself.

= 1.1.5 =
* Fixed an error where there would be no custom menu to show.
* Removed the "Feedback" button due to lack of use. You can still provide feedback via blog comments or email, of course.

= 1.1.4 =
* Fixed the updater's cron hook not being removed when the plugin is deactivated.
* Fixed updates not showing up in some situations.
* Fixed the "Feedback" button not responding to mouse clicks in some browsers.
* Fixed "Feedback" button style to be consistent with other WP screen meta buttons.
* Enforce the custom menu order by using the 'menu_order' filter. Fixes Jetpack menu not staying put.
* You can now copy/paste as many menu separators as you like without worrying about some of them mysteriously disappearing on save.
* Fixed a long-standing copying related bug where copied menus would all still refer to the same JS object instance.
* Added ALT attributes to the toolbar icon images.
* Removed the "Custom" checkbox. In retrospect, all it did was confuse people.
* Made it impossible to edit separator properties.
* Removed the deprecated "level_X" capabilities from the "Required capability" dropdown. You can still type them in manually if you want.

= 1.1.3 = 
* Tests for WordPress 3.2 compatibility.

= 1.1.2 = 
* Fixed a "failed to decode input" error that could show up when saving the menu.

= 1.1.1 = 
* WordPress 3.1.3 compatibility. Should also be compatible with the upcoming 3.2.
* Fixed spurious slashes sometimes showing up in menus.
* Fixed a fatal error concerning "Services_JSON".

= 1.1 = 
* WordPress 3.1 compatibility.
* Added the ability to drag & drop a menu item to a different menu.
* Added a drop-down list of Dashboard pages to the "File" box.
* When the menu editor is opened, the first top-level menu is now automatically selected and it's submenu displayed. Hopefully, this will make the UI slightly easier to understand for first-time users.
* All corners rounded on the "expand" link when not expanded.
* By popular request, the "Menu Editor" menu entry can be hidden again.

= 1.0.1 =
* Added "Super Admin" to the "Required capability" dropdown.
* Prevent users from accidentally making the menu editor inaccessible.
* WordPress 3.0.1 compatibility made official.

= 1.0 =
* Added a "Feedback" link.
* Added a dropdown list of all roles and capabilities to the menu editor.
* Added toolbar buttons for sorting menu items alphabetically.

* In emergencies, administrators can now reset the custom menu by going to http://example.com/wp-admin/?reset\_admin\_menu=1
* Fixed the "Donate" link in readme.txt
* Unbundle the JSON.php JSON parser/encoder and use the built-in class-json.php instead.
* Use the native JSON decoding routine if it's available.
* Replaced the cryptic "Cannot redeclare whatever" activation error message with a more useful one.

= 0.2 =
* Provisional WPMU support.
* Missing and unused menu items now get different icons in the menu editor.
* Fixed some visual glitches.
* Items that are not present in the default menu will only be included in the generated menu if their "Custom" flag is set. Makes perfect sense, eh? The takeaway is that you should tick the "Custom" checkbox for the menus you have created manually if you want them to show up.
* You no longer need to manually reload the page to see the changes you made to the menu. Just clicking "Save Changes" is enough.
* Added tooltips to the small flag icons that indicate that a particular menu item is hidden, user-created or otherwise special.
* Updated the readme.txt

= 0.1.6 =
* Fixed a conflict with All In One SEO Pack 1.6.10. It was caused by that plugin adding invisible sub-menus to a non-existent top-level menu.

= 0.1.5 =
* First release on wordpress.org
* Moved all images into a separate directory.
* Added a readme.txt
